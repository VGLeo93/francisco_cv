Here’s the comprehensive analysis and patch recommendations for the `francisco_cv` codebase as well as step-by-step instructions for deploying the site on GitHub Pages. You can view the detailed report here: {{file:file-YFmZPgUSvU8uFWTJTkC9Yt}}.

Key highlights:

* **CSS Fixes:** The report proposes adding a fallback color for unsupported `color-mix()` calls, reducing anchor scroll offsets on mobile, and introducing a `.sr-only` class for screen-reader-only text.
* **JavaScript Adjustments:** It suggests lowering the scroll threshold for the back-to-top button and adding a `touchstart` handler so the button works reliably on mobile.
* **HTML Updates:** Including Swiper’s CSS/JS in `index.html` will enable the enhanced carousel, and adding hidden text improves accessibility.
* **GitHub Pages Setup:** A step-by-step guide walks through committing changes and enabling Pages via the repository settings.

These changes should resolve the mobile back-to-top issue and prepare the site for smooth hosting on GitHub Pages. Feel free to review and apply the patches to enhance the project.
